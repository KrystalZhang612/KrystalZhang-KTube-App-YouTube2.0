# KTube App -> YouTube 2.0
My replica to YouTube App, one of the largest online video streaming and sharing social media platforms owned by Google. KTube App in React.js using the newest version of Material UI, which contains a stunning new video section, custom categories responsive channel, and video cards channel pages. The user can play the video straight from the App, browse related videos, and search intended videos. Along with building this App, I have learned a lot on API fetching, dependencies and packages management, React functional components and their reusability, React file and folder structure, Vscode extension usage, fetching media queries for satisfactory responsiveness on various devices using RapidAPI to fetch data from unlimited sources.
